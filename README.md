# Airtable Unity Plugin
This is just UnityPackage to make the integration with AirTable platform faster.

If you don't a have a Airtable account, use my code just to pump the work on this.

[Download Airtable Unity Package here](https://github.com/lipemon1/airtableunity/raw/master/Assets/AirtableUnity/AirtableUnityPlugin.unitypackage "Airtable Unity Package").

The idea here is give you a unity package that will enable to connect to any Airtable Base.

It's a very fresh plugin but you can already make the following call:

- List records
- Get a specific record
- Create new record
- Update a record
- Delete a record

There is a example for each call inside the package.

# Dependencies
The whole system is using JsonDotNet to make all the serialization needded. If you need you can use other json serialization plugin but will have to resolve the references.

# Credits
I have to thanks a real ninja unity developer here, [Lucas Straub](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucas-straub-a93990a1/ "Lucas Straub linkedin"). This had been easier to test and develop because the whole Proxy.cs and other core UnityWebRequest scripts structures were desing by this guy. Everyone that use this plugin must say thanks for him to make our unity developers lives better.
